'Gloria in excelsis Deo', performed by the Netherlands Bach Society for All of Bach, was actually part of a short mass that Bach presented as a gift to the Elector of Dresden. So the music was not intended for Leipzig and was not supposed to be performed there. A pity, and maybe Bach thought so too. We do not know precisely why and when he rewrote the gloria from the mass as a cantata. It is remarkable that Bach chose to use a Latin text for his Leipzig arrangement as well, as Latin church music was not common in Leipzig. But evidently an occasion presented itself, and Leipzig could thus enjoy Christmas music in regal style.
