        "description": "Antonín Dvořák\n\nAntonín Leopold Dvořák (8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904) was a Czech composer, one of the first to achieve worldwide recognition. Following the Romantic-era nationalist example of his predecessor Bedřich Smetana, Dvořák frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia. Dvořák's own style has been described as \"the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them\".\nDvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was aged 31. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, but did not win, and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later. In 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works. Although Dvořák was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874[a] and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him. Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances, Op. 46. These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music (of the original piano 4-hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvořák's international reputation was launched at last.\nDvořák's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880. It was very successfully performed in London in 1883, leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States. In his career, Dvořák made nine invited visits to England, often conducting performances of his own works. His Seventh Symphony was written for London. Visiting Russia in March 1890, he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1891 Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory. In 1890–91, he wrote his Dumky Trio, one of his most successful chamber music pieces. In 1892, Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. While in the United States, Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony From the New World, which spread his reputation worldwide, and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti. He also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music, the American String Quartet, during this time. But shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness, led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895.\nAll of Dvořák's nine operas, except his first, have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey the Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works. By far the most successful of the operas is Rusalka. Among his smaller works, the seventh Humoresque and the song \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\" are also widely performed and recorded. He has been described as \"arguably the most versatile... composer of his time\".\n\nSuite in A Major Op. 98 b\n1. Andante con moto                             3:56\n2.

        "description": "Labelle was an American all-female singing group who were a popular vocal group of the 1960s and 1970s. The group was formed after the disbanding of two rival girl groups in the area around Philadelphia and Trenton, the Ordettes and the Del-Capris, forming as a new version of the former group, then later changing their name to the Blue Belles (later Bluebelles). The founding members were Patti LaBelle (formerly Patricia Holt), Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash.\n\n\"Lady Marmalade\" is a song written by Bob Crewe and Kenny Nolan. The song is famous for its sexually suggestive chorus of \"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi (ce soir)?\", which translates into English as \"Do you want to sleep with me (tonight)?\". The song first became a popular hit when it was recorded in 1974 by the American girl group Labelle. Labelle held the number-one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for one week, and also topped the Canadian RPM national singles chart.\nIt reached #1 in the Dutch Top 40 on 8 February 1975 and stayed at the number one spot for 4 consecutive weeks.

        "description": "George Gershwin (September 26, 1898 – July 11, 1937) was an American composer and pianist whose compositions spanned both popular and classical genres. Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and An American in Paris (1928), the songs Swanee (1919) and Fascinating Rhythm (1924), the jazz standard I Got Rhythm (1930), and the opera Porgy and Bess (1935) which spawned the hit Summertime.\n\nGershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark, Henry Cowell, and Joseph Brody. He began his career as a song plugger but soon started composing Broadway theater works with his brother Ira Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris intending to study with Nadia Boulanger, but she refused him; he subsequently composed An American in Paris. He then returned to New York City and wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and DuBose Heyward. It was initially a commercial failure but came to be considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century and an American cultural classic.\n\nGershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores until his death in 1937 from a malignant brain tumor. His compositions have been adapted for use in films and television, and several became jazz standards recorded and covered in many variations.\n\nTracklist:\nPrelúdios para piano\n1.

Finale - Allegro moderato \n\n42:15 Waldesruhe / From the Bohemian Forest - Silent Woods, Op.68-5\n\nCello : Jacqueline Du Pré \nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra \nConductor : Daniel Barenboim \nRecorded in 1970\nNew mastering in 2020 by AB for CMRR\nFind CMRR's recordings on Spotify : https://spoti.fi/3016eVr\n\nNicknamed \"La Ginette Neveu du violoncelle\" (the Ginette Neveu of the Cello) by Paul Tortelier, Jacqueline Du Pré has had a dazzling career, destroyed by illness at only 27 years of age.Her husband Daniel Barenboim says of her: \"She was a unique musician (...), she wasn't exactly familiar with what to do with music in a musicological or scientific way, but she had an astonishing instinct and speed of mind that was mind-boggling.  She was seeing a piece for the first time and she was able not only to play the notes but also to get to the essential\". This instinct that characterizes her we feel it wonderfully in the works of Dvorak, the sound, the magnificent phrasing, the bow attacks, the spontaneity, the always precise accompaniment of Barenboim, the power of the Chicago Orchestra very famous for its brass section, everything is present to make this recording a legendary one.\n\nDvořák composa son concerto pour violoncelle aux Etats-Unis, en 1895. Ce concerto remporta un grand succès lors de sa création, succès qui n’a jamais cessé de l’accompagner depuis. Il est devenu une sorte de passage obligé des grands interprètes. Brahms lui-même, l’ayant entendu se serait exclamé : « Pourquoi ne m’a-t-on pas dit que l’on pouvait écrire un concerto pour violoncelle comme celui-ci ? Si seulement je m’en étais douté, j’en aurais écrit un depuis longtemps ». Après avoir composé ce concerto, Dvořák n’écrivit plus aucun concerto ! Celui-ci brille comme une étoile solitaire, tout en intériorité. Il se voit profondément marqué par la nostalgie du pays natal. Cependant, Dvořák ne laisse pas son art lui céder, et l’optimisme reprend toujours le dessus. \n\nLe premier mouvement se distingue par la longueur inhabituelle de son introduction orchestrale, qui semble faite pour préparer l’entrée saisissante du soliste. Les premières notes du violoncelle son fermes et péremptoires et le développement qui suit traverse des états d’âme puissants, développant une richesse mélodique qui atteint le lyrisme..\nLe second mouvement, introduit et soutenu avec une douceur mélancolique par le pupitre des vents, développe au violoncelle une mélodie somptueuses (une émotion profonde mais retenue). Un tutti orchestral apparait brutalement. Alors se déploie un nouveau thème mélodique, lui aussi d’un très grande beauté. Dvořák aurait peut-être composé ou modifié ce mouvement après avoir reçu la nouvelle de la maladie grave de sa belle-soeur, Josefina Cermakova, dont il avait été amoureux avant son mariage..\nDans le dernier mouvement, l’orchestre et le soliste s’entraine l’un l’autre dans un élan ascendant, d’une vigueur héroïque. Le tout évolue, entrecoupé de passage plus pensifs, notamment la coda du violoncelle, qui aurait été ajoutée par Dvořák après l’annonce de la mort de sa belle soeur aimée. Mais irrésistiblement le ton s’élève dans la joie jusqu’à la conclusion finale, peut-être préfiguration du bonheur du retour au pays. \n\nLe calme de la forêt est un morceau lyrique qui vient avec le temps \"Lent et très chantante\" pour l'introduction, un thème de rêve en ré bémol majeur, récupéré après un intermède (un peu plus rugueux) en do dièse mineur. Le projet initial, Op. 68, a eu lieu en 1883 à la demande de Fritz Simrock. Célèbre pour ses arrangements d'œuvres populaires pour d'autres instruments, Dvořák a arrangé la cinquième pièce pour violoncelle et piano, à l'occasion d'une tournée d'adieu qui a été préparé avec le violoniste Ferdinand Lachner et le violoncelliste Hanus Wihan, avant de mettre les voiles pour le Nouveau Monde. L’arrangement a atteint une telle renommée que Dvořák a fait un nouvel arrangement pour violoncelle et orchestre.\n\nElgar - Cello Concerto, Delius - Cello Concerto (recording of the Century: Jacqueline Du Pré) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcABXRl-IvQ&list=PL3UZpQL9LIxMNnNaMjV-GnzwKtcaU10fB\n\nBrahms - The Cello Sonatas n°1,2 / NEW MASTERING (Century’s record. : Jacqueline Du Pré / Barenboim) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mdFVO1Nyv4&list=PL3UZpQL9LIxOfigsjIfHNN6AuqZVVmfGR&index=14\n\nAntonín Dvořák PLAYLIST (reference recordings) : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3UZpQL9LIxOmR1pAUFUL-0JK-EcbVFUG",
